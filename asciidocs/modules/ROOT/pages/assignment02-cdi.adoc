== Instructions

Continue your microproject:

=== Create a new Quarkus Project in the given github-Repository

* Transfer the sources of the old project to the new gh-repository
* The new project is supposed to be "clean"
** The project root is located in the gh-repo root

=== Create (ie) three Entities

=== Install a plantuml-plugin

* https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7017-plantuml-integration


=== Create a plantuml-class-diagram

* Create a `plantuml` - directory in your `asciidoc` - folder
* right Mouseclick on the plantuml-folder and choose "New"-"PlantUML File"
** Name the file `cld`
** Choose "class"
* a cld.puml file is created

.structure of the asciidoc-folder
----
|-- images
|   `-- ...
|-- index.adoc
|-- ...
`-- plantuml
    `-- cld.puml
----

=== Design your Class Diagram

=== Include the cld into your asciidoc-file

****
image:include-puml-file.png[]
****

.a example for the rendered puml-file
[plantuml, cld, png, align=left]
----
include::plantuml/cld.puml[]
----

=== Include the Class Diagram into your README.md

* Copy the generated png-file into the image-folder in your project
* Include the png into the README.png
* Describe in your README.md
** What is the idea of your microproject
** What are you implementing
*** Use-Case-Diagram
*** Class-Diagram

=== Create the Repositories for the Entities

* The data is stored in collections.
We are still using *no* databases.

* Use cdi for injecting the repositories

=== Identify three User Stories

* Create a ucd.puml for the use-case-diagram

IMPORTANT: These use-cases are the foundation for crud-operations and queries and also for the system-tests.

=== Create Endpoints for your User Stories

* Use cdi for injecting the repositories

=== Create Tests for the Entities, Repositories and User Stories

* Make unit-tests for the entities
** test the methods ie the toString()-method
** ...

* Create integration-tests for the repositories
** use assertj-core

* Create system-tests for the endpoints (restful resources)
** use RESTassured

=== Create a swagger-ui for your Endpoints

* Document the three user stories for swagger in the source code

== What to pay attention for ...

* The project should be clean
** the quarkus-project is located in the root of the git repo
** the commits are usable for following the development of the microproject

== gh-pages
